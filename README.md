## Scenario
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. The companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## **1. Business task** 
Analyze riderâ€™s riding data to develop digital marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

Primary stakeholders: The director of marketing Lily Moreno and Cyclistic executive team.

Secondary stakeholders: Cyclistic marketing analytics team.

## **2. Prepare**
Data Source: 12 Month (Aug 2020 to August 2021) of Cyclistic trip Data from Motivate International Inc: [data source link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) with [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

The dataset has 12 CSV, 13 columns and 4.9 million rows. The data also follow a ROCCC approach:

- Reliability: the data includes complete and accurate ride data from Divvy. Divvy is program of the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), which owns the cityâ€™s bikes, stations and vehicles
- Original: the data is from Motivate International Inc, which operates the City of Chicagoâ€™s Divvy bicycle sharing service.
- Comprehensive: The data incudes type of bikes, start and end station name, start and end time, station ID, station longtitude and latitude, membership types.
- Current: data is up to date to August 2021
- Cited: the data is cited and under current [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) agreement.

ðŸš« The dataset has limitations:

- Personally identifiable information: the dataset has a restriction of personally identifiable information, so we have no data if that a ride is by an unique rider or the same rider who ride more than once as a casual rider or a member. 
- NA values: after checking `sum(is.na(bike_data))`, we see the dataset has 1893790 NA values, such as in starting_station_id, end_station_id. Further investigation we noticed the NA values are mostly under rideable type: electric bike. Future investigations may be needed by the station names are not entered for electric bike. 

  ```
  head(count(bike_data, start_station_name, member_casual,  rideable_type, sort= TRUE))
  
  head(count(bike_data, end_station_name, member_casual,  rideable_type, sort= TRUE))
  ```

## **3. Process**

Steps to clean and remove unnecessary data in R Studio.

 **Examine the data:** 

```
head(bike_data)
dim(bike_data)
colnames(bike_data)
summary(bike_data)
```

**Indentify unnecessary data and remove those columns:**

```
bike_data <- bike_data %>% select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
```

**Add two columns: ride length and day of the week:** 
```
bike_data <- bike_data %>% mutate(ride_length = ended_at - started_at) %>% mutate(day_of_week = weekdays(as.Date(bike_data$started_at)))

#Convert ride_length from from seconds into minutes
bike_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(bike_data$ride_length)
bike_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(bike_data$ride_length/60)
```

**âœ… Optional: the started and ended time is in a yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss format. We can further divide this into two columns: date and time:
```
bike_data <- separate(bike_data,"started_at",into=c('start_date','start_time'), sep=' ')
bike_data <- separate(bike_data,"ended_at",into=c('start_date','start_time'), sep=' ')
```

**Remove data error:**

```
#check for data with negative ride length:
bike_data <- bike_data[bike_data$ride_length>0,]

#check for data with ride length  more than 1 day (86400 seconds or 1440 mins):
sum(bike_data$ride_length > 1440)
```

## 4. Analyze

Check min, max, mean, median and any outlier on the ride length.
```
summary(bike_data$ride_length)
```

Aggregate the data based on user types.
```
aggregate(bike_data$ride_length ~ bike_data$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(bike_data$ride_length ~ bike_data$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(bike_data$ride_length ~ bike_data$member_casual + bike_data$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

Analyze ridership by user types and day of the week.
```
bike_data %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								
 ```

## 6. Act
Conclusion based on our analysis:
- Casual riders rides mostly during the weekends.
- Casual riders ride longer duration, but least total trips. 
- Casual riders rides longer on docked bike, but least total trips.
- Most popular station for casual riders are: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park.
- Most active months for casual riders are from June to August.

Marketing ideas to convert casual riders into members:

#### 1. Marketing effort on the top 5 most popular stations for the causal riders.

#### 2. Promotional short term membership offer during the summer months.

#### 3. Promotional weekend term membership for the weekends.

#### 4. Points incentive for riding more trips in a membership format to receive discount.
